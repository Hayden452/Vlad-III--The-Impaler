VLAD PROPER:

Made some changes regarding the for loops and browser submission and closing. Could break. Make sure to test with
multiple and 0 sites.

Use PyCharm to format code properly
Figure out what exceptions will be thrown, if there are exceptions, and account for them in the try-except
Sometimes can't find knownPhishingSites, in PyCharm
Forms other than Google Forms
Different types of phished input
Automatic phishing form detection
REST API
More robust and precise question detection. This appears to be what Vlad will be good at. 
Go directly to the source and ignore the forms for non-googleSoft forms? 
If a link is dead, just ignore it
Convert to database instead of text? Would require a constantly-running database, but that could be done with mySQL on
linux, probably
Malicious domains (like squarespace), VLAD poisons through headers, without worrying about forms, different headers

Does VLAD need:
* IP obscuration? 


VLAD'S Scout:

Terminal HUD
Error handling for if internet goes offline (shouldn't with physical wire, but nonetheless)
Clicking on newest email not working
