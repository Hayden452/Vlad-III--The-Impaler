VLAD PROPER:

Use PyCharm to format code properly
Figure out what exceptions will be thrown, if there are exceptions, and account for them in the try-except
Sometimes can't find knownPhishingSites, in PyCharm
Forms other than Google Forms
Different types of phished input
Automatic phishing form detection
More robust and precise question detection. This appears to be what Vlad will be good at. 
Go directly to the source and ignore the forms for non-googleSoft forms? 
If a link is dead, just ignore it
Malicious domains (like squarespace), VLAD poisons through headers, without worrying about forms, different headers
